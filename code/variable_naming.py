# Let's talk about variables

# variables let us save information so we can reuse it in our code
# later. we create them with an =

# you can name them almost wahtever you want as long as it
# starts with a letter. by convention lowercase letters start the variable
# variable names should be informative

# these work but are not informative
a = "yum"
b = 5
c = 3.2

# insteade we should be finformative
current_feeling = "hungry"
currentYear = 2023
currentyear = 2023

# please never do this
str = "friend"
int = 52
