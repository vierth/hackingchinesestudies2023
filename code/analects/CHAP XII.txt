1. Tsze-yu said, 'The disciples and followers ofnTsze-hsia, in sprinkling and sweeping the ground, in answering andnreplying, in advancing and receding, are sufficiently accomplished.nBut these are only the branches of learning, and they are leftnignorant of what is essential.-- How can they be acknowledged asnsufficiently taught?'n 2. Tsze-hsia heard of the remark and said, 'Alas! Yen Yu isnwrong. According to the way of the superior man in teaching, whatndepartments are there which he considers of prime importance, andndelivers? what are there which he considers of secondarynimportance, and allows himself to be idle about? But as in the casenof plants, which are assorted according to their classes, so he dealsnwith his disciples. How can the way of a superior man be such as tonmake fools of any of them? Is it not the sage alone, who can unitenin one the beginning and the consummation of learning?'nn
