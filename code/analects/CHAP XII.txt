1. Tsze-yu said, 'The disciples and followers ofTsze-hsia, in sprinkling and sweeping the ground, in answering andreplying, in advancing and receding, are sufficiently accomplished.But these are only the branches of learning, and they are leftignorant of what is essential.-- How can they be acknowledged assufficiently taught?' 2. Tsze-hsia heard of the remark and said, 'Alas! Yen Yu iswrong. According to the way of the superior man in teaching, whatdepartments are there which he considers of prime importance, anddelivers? what are there which he considers of secondaryimportance, and allows himself to be idle about? But as in the caseof plants, which are assorted according to their classes, so he dealswith his disciples. How can the way of a superior man be such as tomake fools of any of them? Is it not the sage alone, who can unitein one the beginning and the consummation of learning?'
