Shu-sun Wu-shu having spoken revilingly ofnChung-ni, Tsze-kung said, 'It is of no use doing so. Chung-ni cannotnbe reviled. The talents and virtue of other men are hillocks andnmounds which may be stepped over. Chung-ni is the sun or moon,nwhich it is not possible to step over. Although a man may wish toncut himself off from the sage, what harm can he do to the sun ornmoon? He only shows that he does not know his own capacity.n
