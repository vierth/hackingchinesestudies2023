1. Tsze-chang asked Confucius, saying, 'In what wayshould a person in authority act in order that he may conductgovernment properly?' The Master replied, 'Let him honour the fiveexcellent, and banish away the four bad, things;-- then may heconduct government properly.' Tsze-chang said, 'What are meant bythe five excellent things?' The Master said, 'When the person inauthority is beneficent without great expenditure; when he laystasks on the people without their repining; when he pursues whathe desires without being covetous; when he maintains a dignifiedease without being proud; when he is majestic without being fierce.' 2. Tsze-chang said, 'What is meant by being beneficentwithout great expenditure?' The Master replied, 'When the personin authority makes more beneficial to the people the things fromwhichthey naturally derive benefit;-- is not this being beneficent withoutgreat expenditure? When he chooses the labours which are proper,and makes them labour on them, who will repine? When his desiresare set on benevolent government, and he secures it, who willaccuse him of covetousness? Whether he has to do with manypeople or few, or with things great or small, he does not dare toindicate any disrespect;-- is not this to maintain a dignified easewithout any pride? He adjusts his clothes and cap, and throws adignity into his looks, so that, thus dignified, he is looked at withawe;-- is not this to be majestic without being fierce?' 3. Tsze-chang then asked, 'What are meant by the four badthings?' The Master said, 'To put the people to death without havinginstructed them;-- this is called cruelty. To require from them,suddenly, the full tale of work, without having given themwarning;-- this is called oppression. To issue orders as if withouturgency, at first, and, when the time comes, to insist on them withseverity;-- this is called injury. And, generally, in the giving payor rewards to men, to do it in a stingy way;-- this is called actingthe part of a mere official.' CHAP III. 1. The Master said, 'Without recognising theordinances of Heaven, it is impossible to be a superior man. 2. 'Without an acquaintance with the rules of Propriety, it isimpossible for the character to be established. 3. 'Without knowing the force of words, it is impossible toknow men.'End of Project Gutenberg Etext THE CHINESE CLASSICS (CONFUCIAN ANALECTS)by James Legge
