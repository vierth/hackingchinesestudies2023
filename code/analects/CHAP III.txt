The disciples of Tsze-hsia asked Tsze-chang aboutthe principles that should characterize mutual intercourse. Tsze-chang asked, 'What does Tsze-hsia say on the subject?' Theyreplied, 'Tsze-hsia says:-- "Associate with those who can advantageyou. Put away from you those who cannot do so."' Tsze-changobserved, 'This is different from what I have learned. The superiorman honours the talented and virtuous, and bears with all. Hepraises the good, and pities the incompetent. Am I possessed ofgreat talents and virtue?-- who is there among men whom I willnot bear with? Am I devoid of talents and virtue?-- men will putme away from them. What have we to do with the putting away ofothers?'
