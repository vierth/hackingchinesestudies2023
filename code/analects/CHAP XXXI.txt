The Master said, 'The object of the superior mannis truth. Food is not his object. There is plowing;-- even in thatnthere is sometimes want. So with learning;-- emolument may benfound in it. The superior man is anxious lest he should not get truth;nhe is not anxious lest poverty should come upon him.'n
