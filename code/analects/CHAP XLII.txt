The Master was playing, one day, on a musicalstone in Wei, when a man, carrying a straw basket, passed the doorof the house where Confucius was, and said, 'His heart is full who sobeats the musical stone.' 2. A little while after, he added, 'How contemptible is theone-ideaed obstinacy those sounds display! When one is taken nonotice of, he has simply at once to give over his wish for publicemployment. "Deep water must be crossed with the clothes on;shallow water may be crossed with the clothes held up."' 3. The Master said, 'How determined is he in his purpose! Butthis is not difficult!'
