# in python boolean values are either True or False
# boolean statements are logical sequences that evalute
# to either true or false

# boolean operators return True if expression is true
# False if it is false

# check if two values are the same
print(5 == 5)

# check if two values are NOT the same
print(5 != 5)

# test if one value is larger than another
print(5 > 6)
# less than
print(5 < 6)
# greater than or equal to
print(5 >= 6)
# less than or equal to
print(5 <= 6)

# check if two strings are the same
"a" == "b"

# chekc if two lists are the same
a = ["hello"]
b = ["hello"]
print(a is b)

c = a 
print(c is a)

print(a == b)
